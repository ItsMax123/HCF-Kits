**WARNING! BUG FOUND:** When using bard items, rigt clicking will only give the enhanced effects to 1 player instead of all the facion members. Will fix soon. This will not effect your server in any negative way.

## Rogue

Rogue: A player with full chain armor.

Backstab: When a rogue hits another player in the back with a gold sword.

When a rogue backstabs someone, the victim will loose 50% of their current health and may receive effects if allowed in config. The rogue's gold sword will disapear after the backstab, he will also receive effects if allowed in config and his backstab cooldown will start. By putting full rogue armor, the player receives the armor effects which is configurable in config.

## Bard

**WARNING**: For bard to work with faction members, you need to have the PiggyFactions plugin installed. I will add more compatibility to other faction plugins if anyone asks me to. (Create a github issue to do so OR dm me on discord ItsMax123#6798)

Bard: A player with full gold armor.

Effect Item: Item that has an effect assigned to it in config.

A bard has 2 abilities:
- When a bard is holding an Effect Item, the effect assigned to that Item will be given to all faction members within bard range. There is no cooldown for this ability, so you can scroll over your hotbar and give all effects very fast.
- When a bard clicks an Effect Item, the effect assigned to that Item will be given (with an amplifier of +1) to all faction members within bard range and the bard cooldown will start for that Effect Item specifically.
